This project presents a multimodal federated learning framework for detecting rogue UAVs using RF signal features while ensuring security in distributed training environments. By combining spectral–temporal deep learning models with a Zero-Trust security mechanism, the system actively validates client updates and mitigates poisoning attacks before aggregation. The approach enables privacy-preserving UAV identification, maintains high model integrity even under adversarial conditions, and supports scalable, real-world deployment across distributed edge devices.
